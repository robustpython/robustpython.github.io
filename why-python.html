            <p>Python is a great programming language to learn and use. </p>
<p>These are my reasons why I use it. </p>
<p>I also use other programming languages, but I think Python is best balanced 
language in terms of beauty, usefulness and practicality.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>Most mainstream languages today have C-style syntax (C, Java, JavaScript, C#, 
Go etc).</p>
<p>While this syntax is fine and familiar it is quite verbose and allows 
programmers to go really wild with the code formatting. </p>
<p>Python took a different approach and is not using curly braces to delimit code 
blocks. Rather it's using significant white spaces and code blocks are 
indented. Worth mentioning is the fact that in Python you don't use semicolon <code>;</code> 
at the end of the line.</p>
<p>Take this function written in C-style language for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function my_function(p1, p2) {
    if (p1 &gt; p2) {
        function_a();
      }
    else {
        function_b();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>you can also write it like</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function my_function(p1, p2) {
    if (p1 &gt; p2) {function_a();}
    else 
    { 
          function_b();
    function_c();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>and it will do exactly same thing.</p>
<p>We can write same  function in Python like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def my_function(p1, p2):
    if p1 &gt; p2:
        function_a()
    else:
        function_b()
        function_c()
</code></pre>
<p>But if you change it to</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def my_function(p1, p2):
    if p1 &gt; p2:
        function_a()
    else:
        function_b()
    function_c()
</code></pre>
<p>It is now a different function because <code>function_c</code> will always be called while 
before it was called only  as a part of <code>else</code> branch. </p>
<p>This has an impact on readability and maintainability of the code as programmers 
are forced to style code well in order to make it run.</p>
<p>Python was designed to be highly readable language which is important because 
code is written once but read many times. </p>
<p>Python is also using english words instead of punctuations for logical 
operators. For <em>AND</em> operation it uses word <code>and</code> instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, for <em>OR</em> it
uses word <code>or</code> instead of <code>||</code> , for <em>NOT</em> it uses word <code>not</code> instead of <code>!</code>. </p>
<p>In C style language:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">if (x &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; y &gt; 8 || z == 10) {
    // Do the thing
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Python:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if x &gt; 5 and y &gt; 8 or z == 10:
    # Do the thing
</code></pre>
<h2>Conciseness</h2>
<p>This is partly related to syntax which we've discussed above but Python has 
some really great ways how to do things. </p>
<p>Python is very concise language. </p>
<p>It allows you to do a lot with very little code. That is important because it 
makes code easy and fast to read and write.</p>
<p>You don't have to write a lot of code that is not directly related to the thing
you're trying to achieve. This saves you time and mental energy.</p>
<p>Let's say we want to check that variable <code>number</code> is bigger than <code>5</code> and 
smaller than <code>10</code>. In C style languages you would do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">if (number &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; number &lt; 10) {
    // Do the thing
} 
</code></pre>
<p>in Python, we have chained comparison, and you can do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if 5 &lt; number &lt; 10:
    # Do the thing
</code></pre>
<p>It's a similar story if you want to get part of a list (array). In Python, you 
can use slicing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [1, 2, 3 , 4, 5]

first_two = numbers[:2]
</code></pre>
<p>while in C style languages you'd do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let first_two = numbers.slice(0, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>in</code> operator we can check if item is in the list or other data structure. </p>
<p>To check if number is in the list we'd write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

if 5 in numbers:
    # Do the thing
</code></pre>
<p>Or if a key is in the dictionary: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if 'my_key' in my_dict:
   # Do the thing
</code></pre>
<p>It can be also used to check if a string contains another string </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if 'python' in 'Robust python':
    # Do the thing
</code></pre>
<p>Comprehensions are another great feature of Python which makes our code super 
concise. </p>
<p>You can create a list, a set or a dictionary in one line. 
You can also map and filter with them. For example, to create a list of squares 
of numbers from one to ten in C style language you'd do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let squares = [];

for (i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) { 
    squares.push(i*i)
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Python, we can achieve the same with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">squares = [i * i for i in range(1, 11)]
</code></pre>
<p>To get only squares bigger than 50, in Python we could just do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">big = [s for s in squares if s &gt; 50]
</code></pre>
<p>This conciseness and clarity of Python  makes you very productive as a developer
while your code is still easily readable and understandable to others.</p>
<h2>Multi paradigm</h2>
<p>In Python, we can choose which programming paradigm we want to use for our 
program. </p>
<p>You can do most traditional 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming">imperative (procedural)</a> 
programming where series of statements are executed in order.</p>
<p>Python also supports 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object oriented programming</a> 
paradigm where you create hierarchies of classes with methods. It supports 
polymorphism, inheritance (including multiple inheritance) and other OOP 
concepts.</p>
<p>Last but not the least Python has a great support for functional programming. It
has list, dict, sets and generator expression - comprehensions.<br>
All functions in Python are 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function">first class functions</a> 
, so they can be passed around and manipulated as any other object. This allows 
it to have 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher-order functions</a>
like map,
filter and reduce. Lot of other functions to support functional programming is 
in <em>itertools</em> and <em>functools</em> modules.</p>
<h2>Versatile</h2>
<p>We can do pretty much anything in Python. </p>
<ul>
<li>simple scripts to automate some trivial tasks</li>
<li>websites with millions of users</li>
<li>heavy data processing backends</li>
<li>APIs</li>
<li>desktop apps</li>
<li>software for IoT (Internet of Things, think RaspberryPi, Arduino etc.)</li>
<li>data visualisation</li>
<li>ML</li>
<li>and so much more</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why many major companies (Amazon, Google, Netflix, 
Instagram, Dropbox, Spotify, NASA and so on) and millions of small companies 
and independent developer across the world use Python.</p>
<h2>Runs almost everywhere</h2>
<p>Python runs on most of the relevant platforms today. It runs on x86, x86_64 and
ARM. It also runs on all major operating systems of today - Linux, Windows, 
macOS and even FreeBSD.</p>
<p>You can write your code where you prefer, and it can be run almost anywhere.</p>
<h2>Community and libraries</h2>
<p>Python is open source, independent and community driven language. 
It has a vast community of developers and enthusiasts.  </p>
<p>They're very supportive and friendly which is huge benefit for both new and 
expert developers. </p>
<p>Community is dedicated to maintain and spread the language and that means there
is an astonishing amount of libraries to help you with whatever you need to do.</p>
<p>Frameworks like Django and Flask (for web development), Numpy, Panda , NLTK, 
PyTorch (for ML and data science) and thousands of libraries for almost anything
you can think of which are free to use and open source.</p>
<p>There are thousands of Python developers willing to help you with your problem 
if you just ask.</p>
<h2>Machine Learning and Data science</h2>
<p>Machine learning and data science are on the rise over the last few years and 
will continue to grow in coming years. </p>
<p>You can use any language for ML and data science related tasks but Python has 
become a preferred  language for this domain. Most companies and even most of 
the tutorials and courses use Python as the language of choice for ML domain.</p>
<p>It's thanks to Python's strengths which we mentioned already above:</p>
<ul>
<li>syntax and conciseness - which makes developers very productive and allows even beginners to write good code</li>
<li>exhaustive libraries which gives you solution to all existing problems</li>
<li>community build around whole ML domain</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you're interested in Machine learning then Python is definitely language 
you want to learn.</p>
<h2>Gradual typing</h2>
<p>Python is a dynamic language. </p>
<p>It has its advantages and disadvantages which I don't want to discuss here in 
detail, but it means you can write code without worrying about types and 
compiler which is checking them. </p>
<p>This is great if you need to just write a little script to automate something, 
or you want to build a prototype of the idea (Minimal Viable Product) or have 
a smaller project with few people.</p>
<p>However, for bigger projects with more developers types are very useful as they 
help you write more robust code, and you can catch more errors before the code 
is run. </p>
<p>It would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import List

def function_a(a: int, b: List[str]):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>In above function  parameter <code>a</code> has to be of type <code>int</code> and parameter <code>b</code> must 
be list of strings - <code>List[str]</code>.</p>
<p>Beauty of Python is that you can have both. You can write your code without 
types, but you can also add type annotations if you want to. </p>
<p>Then you can use static type checker like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org">mypy</a> to do 
the type checking for you to help you catch any possible errors. 
You can choose to use types from beginning of the project (or after you've build
MVP), or you can start your project without types and introduce them much later 
when your code base and number of developers grow.</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>Python has been around for 30 years and over time it's only growing in 
popularity. It is used in startups, small and medium companies as well as
in big enterprises. 
This creates constant demand for Python programmers all over the world. 
And Python jobs come with high salaries.
Whether you want to build a career as an employee in small or big company, or
you want to be an independent developer or build your own business, Python is 
going to serve you well.</p>
